<h2>How to play</h2>
<p>
    It's very simple to play the game. Just choose a game and think about the solution.
    You can move a geometric block with your mouse, if you press the left mouse button on it.
    Maybe you have to spin the geometric block. Than you can try the keys "W", "A", "S" and "D".
