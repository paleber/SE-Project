                <p>
                    Scongo is a simple geometric puzzle game, where you have to fit some geometric blocks into a shape, so
                    that the hole shape is filled. There are several levels were you can test your spatial sense. In the first
                    implementation it's only possible to play against the time. A competitive mode is in favor.

                <h2>How to play it</h2>
                <p>
                    It's very simple to play the game. Just choose a level and think about the solution.
                    You can move a geometric block with your mouse, if you press the left mouse button on it.
                    Maybe you have to spin the geometric block. Than you can try the keys "W", "A", "S" and "D".

                <dl>
                    <dt>W</dt>
                    <dd>Mirror block vertically</dd>
                    <dt>A</dt>
                    <dd>Rotate block counterclockwise</dd>
                    <dt>S</dt>
                    <dd>Mirror block horizontally</dd>
                    <dt>D</dt>
                    <dd>Rotate block clockwise</dd>

                <p>
                    The original game is called Ubongo and published by Kosmos. Because we implement this game in Scala
                    we call it "Scongo". If you want to learn more about Ubongo, you can visit
